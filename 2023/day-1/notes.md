# Notes

+ I want to use a trie data structure, but not immediately sure how to implement it. I think this could be useful to ensure we only have to go once through each line. We check whether each prefix is in the trie and as soon as we get a value that's actually a number (the trie node could have that as its value) we have successfully identified a number and can continue looking.
